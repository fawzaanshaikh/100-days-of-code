**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: March 17, 2021

### Day 3: March 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Tried a few of my own animations with the help of CSS and JS (mainly JS). Also studied about Git and GitHub so that I can finally start working with the CLI.

**Thoughts**: Realized how beautiful and demanding the process of animation in Web Development can be.

### Day 4: March 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Pushed my local repository to my remote repository on GitHub using Git Bash. Also, understood the problems that my animations had. Mostly to do with the parent-child relationship between elements.

**Thoughts**: My first git push felt really good. I did have a few problems and ended up deleting entire repositories, but then I got the hang of it. I'm pushing this log folder of mine with the Git CLI! Also, understood the problems with my animations. Will be working on them, too.
